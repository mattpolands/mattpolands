### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Matt, and I am a Clinician and an aspiring Data Scientist and Researcher. 

I have spent hundreds of hours studying data science and have completed several certifications (Data Scientist with Python in [datacamp](https://www.datacamp.com/portfolio/matthewdpoland), Python for Data Science and Machine Learning, Math for Data Science Masterclass, Complete SQL, and Master Git).  

The goal of this hub is to synthesize my knowledge so that I can grow from a novice to an intermediate. 

My GitHub page is currently a work in progress. My [GitHub Gist](https://gist.github.com/mattpolands) maps out my data science path and currently showcases the top-shelf education that I have received from [Pierian Training](https://pieriantraining.com/learn/python-for-machine-learning/) as well as countless other generous and brillant researchers, analysts, scientists, and mathematicians.
