### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Matt, and I am a Clinician and an aspiring Data Scientist and Researcher. 

I have spent over a thousand hours studying data science and have completed several tracks (Data Scientist with Python, Python for Data Science and Machine Learning, Math for Data Science Masterclass, and Complete SQL).  

The goal of this hub is to synthesize my knowledge so that I can grow from a novice to an intermediate. 

My [GitHub Gist](https://gist.github.com/mattpolands) and [Datacamp Portfolio](https://www.datacamp.com/portfolio/matthewdpoland) pages map out my data science path and showcase the top-shelf education that I have received from [Pierian Training](https://pieriantraining.com/learn/python-for-machine-learning/), Datacamp, and countless other generous and brillant researchers, analysts, scientists, and mathematicians.
