### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Matt, and I'm a clinician and an aspiring data scientist. My background is as a Physician Assistant where I've dedicated my time to trauma and critical care. A curiosity in how big data was affecting medical research brought me to several projects that were working on models that were attempting to predict disease outcomes. I found the whole process fascinating, and the computer science, statistics, and data visualization have sucked me in. 

The many intellectual challenges of data science have only fueled my interest, and although I am still very green, every day I am seeing myself more and more as a data scientist. My GitHub profile maps out the start of my data science path, and currently showcases the top-shelf education that I received from [Pierian Training](https://pieriantraining.com/learn/python-for-machine-learning/).
