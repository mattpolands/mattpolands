### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Matt, and I am a clinician and an aspiring data scientist. 

I have spent hundreds of hours studying elements of the field (Data Scientist with Python in datacamp, Python for Data Science and Machine Learning, Complete SQL, and Master Git with Pierian Training, Math for Data Science Masterclass with Krista King and Jose Portilla).  

My knowledge has undoubtedly grown, but at times I have found myself unnerved at the mere scope of information tied to data science. An overwhelmed brain is a scattered one. The goal of this hub is to help synthesize all of these amazing resources so that I can grow from a novice to an intermediate. 

My GitHub page is currently a work in progress. My [GitHub Gist](https://gist.github.com/mattpolands) maps out my data science path and currently showcases the top-shelf education that I have received from [Pierian Training](https://pieriantraining.com/learn/python-for-machine-learning/) as well as countless other generous and brillant researchers, analysts, scientists, and mathematicians.
