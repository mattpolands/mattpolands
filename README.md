### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Matt, and I am a clinician and an aspiring data analyst. 

My interest for data science was spurred on by my effort to better understand statistics. With statistics front of mind, I started to see probability in everything. Not only did it drive every decision that I made in medicine, but I noted it in every aspect of my waking life. Once you see probability everywhere, you see big data everywhere, and this is how I got sucked into the vortex that is data science.

Since then I have been working to develop my data science education. As someone who has spent what feels like a kingâ€™s ransom on formal education I found the prospect of the non-traditional path tantalizing. After trialing a few tutorials (Data Science with R and Barton Paulson and Python for Everybody by Dr. Charles Severance), I realized this path was a real possibility. In the last year and a half I have spent hundreds of hours studying elements of the field (Python for Data Science and Machine Learning, Complete SQL Bootcamp, and Master Git and Github with Pierian Training, Math for Data Science Masterclass with Krista King and Jose Portilla) and the quality of free and low cost teaching has been nothing short of astounding.  

However, at times I have found myself unnerved at the mere quantity of data science materials available. An overwhelmed brain is a scattered one, and this has led me to poor organizational habits such as filling up several notebooks worth of knowledge and practice, which in one way shows a fervor for the field but works as a terrible index for reinforcement learning. My goal with this GitHub page is to help me synthesize all of these amazing resources so that I can grow from a novice to an intermediate. 

My GitHub page is currently a work in progress. My [GitHub Gist](https://gist.github.com/mattpolands) profile maps out the start of my data science path, and currently showcases the top-shelf education that I received from [Pierian Training](https://pieriantraining.com/learn/python-for-machine-learning/) as well as countless other generous and brillant analysts, scientists, and mathematicians.
